Background and motivation
With the advent of online dating apps like Tinder and Hinge, meeting new people to go out on dates has become easier than ever. The problem here lies in that often times, people go out on dates with strangers whom they have absolutely no association to and may inadvertently be putting themselves in risky or dangerous scenarios, such as date rape and kidnapping. It is an unfortunate truth that at least several of us have either experienced risky dating scenarios firsthand or know someone else who has-- date-related harassment and violence is a persistent problem, especially among college students and young adults. 
In a recent 2020 article from Propublica.org, the author summarizes that “Dating apps and the companies that own them talk a lot about caring about users’ safety. 
But when the users we talked to reported their attackers on platforms, they often heard nothing in return. And their attackers' profiles stayed active”. 
Companies like Bumble and Tinder have been criticized for their complacency in handling cases such as first-date rape on their online dating platforms. 
Although we have no power over the jurisdiction of big-name dating apps, we believe we can make a positive impact in the world of online dating by giving users a tool to help promote their safety on dates.
To help mitigate the instances of such unfortunate events, our team has decided to build an app that people can utilize during dates to promote their personal safety and wellbeing. The DateSafe app hopes to promote a community of responsible, conscientious persons that are on the watchout for their own wellbeing and that of others. 
In the future, we hope to expand this app such that it can also be used for riders who feel uncomfortable during a ride with a Lyft or Uber driver, find themselves lost during a hike, feel endangered while traveling alone, etcetera. 

Our goal, mission, and hope is that the DateSafe app can bring a peace of mind to its users, knowing that they have support whenever they may need it. 


Summary:
No one wants their loved ones in danger and seeing the ones you love hurt is the worst. 
This app does everything to prevent that from happening. 
With the Date Safe app, when something seems amiss during a date or any interaction, the app pinpoints your location and in turn, the authorities will be notified. 
Given the time constraints, we will focus on implementing an Agile-like approach and keep the interface simple but functional; main features will include geolocation tracking, a button that allows you to alert others that you are in danger, and the ability to capture images of a potential threat. 

Features
Emergency Button (Jeein Kim) - This app will feature a simple, readily accessible emergency button that immediately sends out a message to your friends, family, and the nearest PD.
This feature will likely be the first shown upon opening the app, so that it is easy to click and alert your loved ones/officers that you are feeling endangered. We will not include a login/password authentication to maintain feasibility of access. Sample models to follow include apps like bSafe and FamilyLocator. 
Camera Feature (Nicholas Caro) - This feature will allow you to inconspicuously take photos of the person whom you are with, without showing a typical camera screen. The photos will be sent to your chosen list of emergency contacts. You may also customize the name of the app itself to make it less obvious that you are reaching out for help.
This feature will likely take the form of another simple button that allows the user to take photos of a potential threat without being noticed. This feature will be similar to the emergency button feature in terms of style and orientation, and follow similar aforementioned models. The focus, again, is on user friendly, easy access to the safety features. 
Social Networking (All Developers) - This feature will allow you to connect with other users who have the app, to share experiences and tips on how to better promote safety. It will likely be in the form of a simple forum that supports a chat client.
We as a team have decided to cohesively work on this particular feature because it is likely the most time-consuming and intricate feature of the app. We are still in the process of deciding how we want the chat client to work and what its interface will look like-- we are looking at models from popular chat clients featured on apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, KakaoTalk and Facebook Messenger. 
Educational Modules (Minh Nguyen) - This feature will largely be educational and provide content on preventative tips and what to do in varying scenarios.
This feature will be more back-oriented in terms of the design given that it is not necessary to open in the event of a dire/risky situation. Users can browse through the app and choose to read the free educational materials whenever they please. This feature shall follow models provided by other apps such as Brilliant and BetterHelp.
Location Tracking (Wangmo Tenzing) - This feature will track your geographic location in real-time and send it to your friends, family, and the nearest PD.
In the background, the location tracking feature will allow the user to provide real-time data on the user’s location so that they can easily be found in the event of a dangerous scenario. It will emulate location tracking services featured on other apps such as Snapchat, Google Maps, and Yelp.
