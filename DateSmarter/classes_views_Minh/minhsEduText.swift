              "    1. Let a trusted friend or family member know where you will be, who you will be with, and the time that you are estimated to return from your date. Be sure to call and check in with that person once you get home.\n",
              "    2. Learn self-defense techniques so that you are better prepared to protect yourself in case of an attack. Check to see if there are any free self-defense courses that are offered on your campus.\n",
              "    3. Know the locations and phone numbers of your local emergency stations so that you can quickly find help if you are in a dangerous situation.\n",
              "    4. Always keep your cell phone fully charged and close by when you are out on a date.\n",
              "    5. Never share your personal information with someone you do not trust. Keep your address and financial information private until you truly know the person you are dating.\n",
              "    6. Only go on dates in areas that you feel safe and comfortable in.\n",
              "    7. Utilize group or double dates if you are going out with someone for the first time. Group dates are the perfect way to get to know someone better while being in a safe and comfortable situation.\n",
              "    8. Always keep an eye on your drinks and food. Stay alert, and never leave your food or drinks unattended.\n",
              "    9. Never invite anyone into your home that you do not trust or know.\n\n")

var modTwo = ("Safe Dating Tips", "  Dating sites and apps are more popular than ever, and connecting with new people can be as simple as swiping right on your smart phone. No matter how you know the person, when meeting someone for the first time, you should take precautions.\n\n",
              "    Meet in Public During the Day", "    Meet in a public place with good lighting. If the person you're talking to or chatting with insists you meet at his or her residence or yours, a parking lot or somewhere private, this is a red flag. A busy daytime coffee shop or restaurant may not be private, but others will be around if an unsafe situation arises.\n",
              "    Tell a Friend", "    Let at least one friend, or more if possible, know where you are going and who you are meeting. Getting your date's first and last name prior to meeting is a good idea, too.\n",
              "    Have Your Own Transportation", "    It's not a good idea to allow your date to pick you up the first time you are going to meet. If things don't go well, you might not want them to know where you live. Also, if you need to make a quick exit, you'll want to have your own vehicle or money for a cab available.\n",
              "    Stay Sober", "    Alcohol and drugs can impair your judgment and incapacitate you, making you vulnerable to robbery or assault. Avoiding alcohol and drugs will help you maintain a level head and presence of mind.\n\n")

var modThree = ("Warning Signs of an Abusive Relationship\n",
                "Extreme Jealousy", "    Jealousy is a sign of insecurity and lack of trust, but the abuser will say that it is a sign of love. The abuser will question the victim about who they talk to, accuse them of flirting, or be jealous of time spent with their friends, family, or children. The abuser may refuse to let the victim work or go to school for fear of meeting someone else. The abuser may call the victim frequently or drop by unexpectedly.\n",
                "Controlling Behavior", "    One partner completely rules the relationship and makes the decisions. This includes \"checking up\" on the victim, timing a victim when they leave the house, checking the odometer on the car, questioning the victim about where they go. They may also check the victim's cell phone for call history, their email or website history. The abuser may control the finances and tries to tell the victim how to dress, who to talk to, and where to go.\n",
                "Quick Involvement", "    The abuser comes on strong at the beginning of the relationship, pressuring for a commitment and claims \"Love at first sight\" or \"You're the only person I could ever talk to\", or \"I never met anyone like you before\". Often, in the beginning of a relationship, the abuser is very charming and romantic and the love is intense.\n",
                "Unrealistic Expectations", "    Abusers expect their partners to meet all their needs and be \"perfect\". They may say things like \"If you love me, then I'm all you need\".",
                "Isolation", "    The abuser tries to keep the victim from friends and family by putting down everyone the victim knows, including their family and friends. They may keep the victim from going to work or school.\n",
                "Blames Others", "    The abuser does not take responsibility for their problems, blaming others (usually the victim) for almost everything (\"you made me mad\").\n",
                "Hypersensitivity", "     An abuser is easily insulted and takes everything as a personal attack and blows things out of proportion.\n",
                "Cruelty to Animals or Children", "    The abuser may punish animals brutally or be insensitive to their pain. They may have unfair expectations of children or tease them until they cry.\n",
                "\"Playful\" Use of Force of Sex", "    The abuser may throw or hold their partner down during sex, may pressure their partner into having sex, may demand sex when their partner is tired or ill or doesn't want to have sex. They may ask the victim to do things they do not want to do.\n",
                "Verbal Abuse", "    The abuser says cruel and harmful things to their victim, degrades them, curses at them, calls them names, or puts down their accomplishments. The abuser tells their victims they are stupid, and unable to function without them. They embarrass and put down the victim in front of others as well.\n",
                "Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde", "    The abuser experiences severe mood swings and the victim may think the abuser has a mental health problem. One minute they can be charming and sweet and the next minute they become angry and explosive. Explosiveness and moodiness are typical of people who beat their partners.\n",
                "Past History of Battering", "    The abuser has a history of past battering of partners and although they may admit to that, they say their previous partner provoked them to do it. A batterer will beat any partner they are with if the person is with them long enough for the violence to begin; situational circumstances do not cause a person to have an abusive relationship.\n",
                "Use of Violence and Threats of Violence", "    Violence can include holding the victim down, restraining them from leaving the room or pushing, shoving or holding them against a wall.\n    Abusers may also throw or break objects as a punishment (breaking treasured possessions), but throwing or breaking objects mostly used to terrorize the victim into submission. The abuser may break or strike objects near the victim to frighten them.\n    Threats of violence include any threat or physical force meant to control the victim: \"I'll kill you\", \"I'll break your neck\", \"If you ever leave, I'll kill you.\"\n\n")
